# Terminal Game
*A Javascript implementation of [assembly_game](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/assembly_game) with a web interface.*

## Demo
A web demo can be found [here](https://zhengzi-archive.com/terminal/). Code on the web version was obfuscated via [obfuscator.io](https://obfuscator.io/) to prevent tampering.

## Notes
* This was originally a part of a larger alternate reality game project, hence the NOVOS branding, copyright 1999 stuff.
* This version uses publically available google fonts. Hence, there are small differences in cosmetic/css design. No functionality should be different.

## Usage
1. Clone repository.
2. Open `index.html` in browser. (No server should be required)
